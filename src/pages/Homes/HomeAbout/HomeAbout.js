            <h5>Most people’s experience of the Norwegian fjords is from the deck of a cruise ship, but it’s more rewarding to set out on foot and explore. Of course, the geography dictates that the walks involve big ups and downs, starting and finishing at the fjord edge. It’s exhilarating and not for the fainthearted.<br/><br/>I fly into Stavanger and pick up my car. It’s a pretty port, tall-masted sailing boats moored in the harbour and rows of 18th century white wooden houses rising from the water’s edge. Normally it’s full of cruise ships, but the pandemic has put a stop to that.  

This is Norway’s Oil City, the North Sea oilfields not far away, and the revenue supports several high-end restaurants. You can eat well here, as I find out during my three nights stay.</h5>
