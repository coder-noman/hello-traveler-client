                <h5>2022 has come, maybe not with a bang as a lot of us may have hoped, but the world goes on and as such I have decided to extend this most beautiful travel blogs list even further with 6 new travel blogs to check out, bringing it to 20, a perfect number for the 2020 year. Without further ado, let's check out all the beautiful travel blogs out there.

                As some of you may know, I have been in the design industry for the past 10 years working as a freelance designer in various companies while also running this blog. In fact, the majority of my income is mostly from my design freelance work over at The Pete Design.

                I value well-designed products and today, I want to dive down into the design of travel blogs and featured the best design travel blogs out there that take storytelling to the next level and hopefully inspire you to create an awesome travel blog of your own.</h5>
